OpenIot is a framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development of IoT applications by eliminating the need to repeatedly write boilerplate code. Its modular structure makes it highly extensible and adaptable for future projects.

OpenIot is built on the ESP32 chip, which provides ample resources and processing power to support a wide range of features. While it may be possible to adapt OpenIot for other chips, the ESP32 remains the primary focus of this framework. Personally, I use OpenIot to develop my own IoT projects.
